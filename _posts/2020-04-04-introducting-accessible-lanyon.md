title: Introducing Accessible-Lanyon
---

Accessible-Lanyon is an opinionated, accessible theme based on [Neo-Lanyon][1]
and [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com). Lanyon is an unassuming
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away
navigation in a hidden drawer.<!-- more --> It's based on
[Poole](https://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler. Neo-Lanyon by @zwotzie. Lanyon
and Poole are by @mdo.

## Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation
for Jekyll themes by @mdo. Poole, and every theme built on it (like
Accessible-Lanyon here) includes the following:

- Complete Jekyll setup included:
  - layouts
  - config
  - [404 page]({{ '/404' | relative_url }})
  - example posts
  - [RSS feed]({{ '/atom.xml' | relative_url }})
  - and [example page]({% link pages/about.md %})
- Mobile friendly design and development
- Dark Mode support
- Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
- Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
- Related posts, courtesy classifier-reborn's Latent Semantic Indexer
- Syntax highlighting, courtesy Rouge (the Ruby-based code snippet highlighter)

## Lanyon features

In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:

- Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) in the top corner
- Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated
  navigation with active link support

learn more.

## Browser support

Accessible-Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project, it supports the
latest versions of Chrome, Edge, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox. But
Internet Explore is not supported.

## Download

Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the
[GitHub repository][2] for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.
